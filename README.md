# Injection Molding Machine ‚Äì PLC Automation

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements a **fully automated Injection Molding Machine control system** using a **Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)**.  
The process cycle is modeled in **ladder logic** and covers all major stages of injection molding:

1. **Clamping** ‚Äì Closing and locking the mold with sufficient force.  
2. **Injection** ‚Äì Feeding molten plastic into the mold cavity under controlled pressure.  
3. **Cooling** ‚Äì Holding the mold closed while the part solidifies.  
4. **Ejection** ‚Äì Opening the mold and ejecting the finished part.

The ladder program ensures **sequential operation, interlocks, and safety conditions** required in an industrial environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Automatic cycle execution (no manual intervention required).  
- State-based control with sequential step transitions.  
- Timers used for **cooling** and **dwell time** management.  
- Safety interlocks for **clamp closed**, **injection ready**, and **ejector return** conditions.  
- Scalable design for integration with real-world I/O modules.
