# Injection Molding Machine ‚Äì PLC Automation

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements a **fully automated Injection Molding Machine control system** using a **Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)**.  
The process cycle is modeled in **ladder logic** and covers all major stages of injection molding:

1. **Clamping** ‚Äì Closing and locking the mold with sufficient force.  
2. **Injection** ‚Äì Feeding molten plastic into the mold cavity under controlled pressure.  
3. **Cooling** ‚Äì Holding the mold closed while the part solidifies.  
4. **Ejection** ‚Äì Opening the mold and ejecting the finished part.

The ladder program ensures **sequential operation, interlocks, and safety conditions** required in an industrial environment.

The process sequence is as follows:

1. **Clamping**  
   - The main actuator moves forward until it reaches the **forward limit switch**.  
   - Once the switch is triggered, the actuator stops, and the mold is securely locked.  

2. **Injection & Cooling**  
   - The screw moves forward and **feeds molten plastic** into the mold for **4 seconds**  
   - Injection continues for extra **2 seconds**.  
   - After 6 seconds, the screw retracts back to its initial position.  
   - The same 4-second retracting time period allows the mold to **cool and solidify** the part.  

3. **Mold Opening**  
   - After screw retraction, the main actuator moves backward until it hits the **backward limit switch**.  

4. **Ejection**  
   - A secondary actuator, mounted within the main actuator, pushes the **finished part out instantly**.  

5. **Cycle Repeat**  
   - Once ejection is complete, the process returns to **Step 1** and repeats automatically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Automatic cycle execution (no manual intervention required).  
- State-based control with sequential step transitions.  
- Timers used for **cooling** and **dwell time** management.  
- Safety interlocks for **clamp closed**, **injection ready**, and **ejector return** conditions.  
- Scalable design for integration with real-world I/O modules.
